The goal of rtweettree is to recursively scrape a twitter tweet and all replies, quotes, retweets and likes (that the API provides, see [here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/rtweet-package-extract-specific-tweets-from-specific-user/45206/2)) and visualize them in a network graph. The functionalities to scrape twitter data are heavily based on the excellent [**rtweet**](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet) package. The graph network manipulation functionalities rely on the amazing [**tidygraph**](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph) package and are visualized with [**ggraph**](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph).

## Responsible use

**rtweettree** should be used in strict accordance with Twitter's [developer terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases).

## Installation

To get the current development version from Github (with the [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) package):

```{r eval=FALSE}
## install dev version of rtweettree from github
remotes::install_github("UrsWilke/rtweettree")
```


## Usage

In order to use **rtweettree** please refer to [the according section of
**rtweet**](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet#usage). It is probably good
advice to first feel comfortable with
[**rtweet**](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet).

## Quick dive-in

First we'll load the package.

```{r load}
library(rtweettree)
```

To give you a quick understanding of the functionalities of this package, it can
be used to scrape data related to a twitter status id `main_status_id` and all
the replies (to replies), quotes, retweets and likes the API provides using
`rtweet` functions under the hood. The status id is the last number in the url
of every tweet on twitter.



```{r rtweettree_data, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
main_status_id <- "1438481824922181635"
l <- rtweettree_data(main_status_id)
```


```{r rtweettree_data_offline, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# in order to make it available offline:
l <- rtweettree_data(tibble::lst(df_main_status, df_tree, df_tls, df_favs, df_retweets))
```

This results in a named list of rtweet dataframes:
```{r l}
l
```

You can then visualize this data with: 

```{r autoplot, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ggplot2::autoplot(l)
```

Under the hood, the scraped data is first transformed into a `tidygraph::tbl_graph()`

```{r tbl_graph, message=FALSE}
g <- rtweettree_tbl_graph(l)
g
```

which is then visualized with ggraph.


A more in-depth example how to create the subtweet network graph from a tweet
`status_id` is shown in the `vignette("visualize_tree")`.

## TODOs:

* clean up code and refactor
* make plotting functions more customizable

## Getting help

If you encounter a bug, please file an issue with a minimal reproducible example on [GitHub](https://github.com/urswilke/rtweettree/issues).
