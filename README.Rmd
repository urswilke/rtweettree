# threadnet

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of threadnet is to scrape all the tweets in a twitter thread and visualize them in a network graph.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of threadnet from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("threadnet") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(threadnet)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
